# SOEN6441_YouTubeAnalyzerProject
A web application that can analyze the live feed of the YouTube Data API.
A simple web interface that takes a string with a single or multiple search keywords (input
text field at top of the page, see Figure 1) and then displays data pertaining to the latest ten
videos matching the keyword(s), below the search field. Each match must include the video
title, owner/channel, number of views, time since the video was posted.

The user must be able to enter new search terms on the output page, which will result in
data for ten more videos being displayed (i.e., a second search will add 10 more results below
the initial ten results from the first search and so on â€“ see Figure 2).
